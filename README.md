Mining frequent itemsets using Apriori algorithm

The data in the json file is first loaded into MongoDB through Python using Python connector. 
Then a connection between Python and MongoDB is established to retrieve data.
This is followed by pre-processing of the data.
Lastly, the Apriori Algorithm is implemented from stratch (without using the Apriori library) to find the closed patterns.
